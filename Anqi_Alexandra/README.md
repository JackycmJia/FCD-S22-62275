In this project, we were looking for a systematic way to design and construct a pavilion that is responsive to the sunlight changes. The idea was inspired by the first-semester architecture assembly for all studios on the CFA lawn, in which we noticed that the tent we sent up was not very helpful in blocking the sun, and the inside was too humid. We explored by taking the base 2d plan and transforming it to create dynamic forms and then placing the diamond-shaped structure on top. We then made the responsive opening of the diamond facade based on the distance between the sunlight (the closer the distance between the sun and the individual center of the diamond, the smaller the opening is). The final product is constructed by the assembly of truss systems with the responsive diamond facade, thus forming this free-standing structure.

**Contents**

- `.pdf` of M6 submission
- additional `.gifs` or animated content
- `.gh` script file
- `.3dm` CAD model file
- this `.md` README

## Instructions for Use

This project uses a _Grasshopper_ script&mdash; which is a file that contains the algorithm to generatively design our spaceframe. You must have Rhino X to open the `.3dm` file.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox
  - Ladybug
  - Pufferfish

Install these dependencies and then open the `.gh` file in Rhino3D.
