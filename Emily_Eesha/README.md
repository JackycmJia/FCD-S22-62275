This is an example project in the FCD S22 repo. It is meant to demonstrate the correct format and content expected for uploading materials. This area is used to reiterate the project description from my M6 submission. I could also describe the M6 prompt.

**Contents**

- `.pdf` of M6 submission
- [`.gifs`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xtq6UDDhdwftuJCevF2du4K4EWiN7Viy/view?usp=sharing) of assembly of pavillion
- [`.gh`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xRKs4cQALHKaU2EkoSQzO58Y2_immf2R/view?usp=sharing) script file
- [`.3dm`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xGP8pP1VEcUayYtYQko_7h4uINvXKOhH/view?usp=sharing) CAD model file
- this `.md` README

## Instructions for Use

To model this project, Grasshoper, along with the aid of a few plug-ins are used. When opened the first step to to cIt contains serveral parameters to adjust the size, shape, etc. of a space-frame design. To run the [`.3dm`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xGP8pP1VEcUayYtYQko_7h4uINvXKOhH/view?usp=sharing) file, you must have Rhino 7.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox
  - Kangaroo
 
Install these dependencies and then open the [`.gh`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xRKs4cQALHKaU2EkoSQzO58Y2_immf2R/view?usp=sharing) file in Rhino3D.
