### Project Description 
#### Trilateral Twists primarily uses the manipulation of triangles to serve programmatic elements and respond to the daylight environment. The pavilion is situated at the grass patch right beside the cross intersection in the cut. As students always occupy the area next to the Fence, we decided to place the pavilion there in order to provide more seating and work space to the community. Rather than using a space frame system solely for structural integrity, the triangularity of the space frame itself insinuates form. Through parametrically experimenting and altering the orientation, rotation, and size of triangular sections along a spline, the strip-like pavillion shapeshifts into different forms that serve different programmatic elements. The sizing of the triangle also determines the size of the panel, thus by increasing the size of the triangles that faces along the sun path, it can provide most efficient shading for the majority of the day while still allowing small seams of light to penetrate through.
### M6 Submission PDF

**Contents**

- `.pdf` of M6 submission
- additional `.gifs` or animated content
- `.gh` script file
- `.3dm` CAD model file
- this `.md` README

## Instructions for Use

This project uses a _Grasshopper_ script&mdash; which is a file that contains the algorithm to generatively design our spaceframe. You must have Rhino X to open the `.3dm` file.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox
  - Ladybug
  - Pufferfish

Install these dependencies and then open the `.gh` file in Rhino3D.

This is an example project in the FCD S22 repo. It is meant to demonstrate the correct format and content expected for uploading materials. This area is used to reiterate the project description from my M6 submission. I could also describe the M6 prompt.
