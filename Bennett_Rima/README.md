This project focuses on packaging and distributing an architectural project. Our pavilion resembles a natural, organic structure that fits nicely within our project’s site. We decided to locate our project on the south side of the College of Fine Arts building inside the peace garden. Our programmatic criteria revolves around the collection of water for reuse and also used for evaporation cooling, and controlling the sun rays to provide optimal shade and protection on the pre-existing seating areas within the site. Our honeycomb type design involves a sense of randomness that allows for three types of panels: panels which are closed, blocking sun and directing water to the base; panels that are closed while still having space for water to sit, allowing for evaporative cooling and possibly become plantable space; and open panels that have a certain depth to them, blocking light at certain portions of the day.

**Contents**

- `.pdf` of M6 submission[Σκηνή.pdf](/Aidan_Henry/apsmith_hvonrint_M6 FINAL.pdf)
- additional `.gifs` or animated content
- `.gh` script file
- `.3dm` CAD model file
- this `.md` README

## Instructions for Use

This project uses a _Grasshopper_ script&mdash; which is a file that contains the algorithm to generatively design our spaceframe. You must have Rhino X to open the `.3dm` file.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox
  - Ladybug

Install these dependencies and then open the `.gh` file in Rhino3D.
