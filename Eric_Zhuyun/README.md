we investigated opportunities of facade panels reacting according to their distance from the sun. As our installation is located in Pittsburgh, PA, USA, southern facade of the structure will receive much more sunlight. Therefore, our installation performs an operation of colsing parts of the facade panels that are the closest to the sun to prevent extremely hot temperature that occupants might feel. The shape of the installation took inspirations from the inclusive envrionment Carnegie Mellon has provided to the student community, and it serve to remind occupants that we are a strong community together. 

**Contents**

- `.pdf` M6 Exhibition posts
- [`Sunlight reaction performance animation`] Sunlight reaction performance animation
- `Assembly animation` or animated content
- `.gh` script file
- `.3dm` CAD model file
- this `.md` README

## Instructions for Use

This project uses a _Grasshopper_ script&mdash; which is a file that contains the algorithm to generatively design our spaceframe. You must have Rhino X to open the `.3dm` file.

**Dependencies**

The _Grasshopper_ script uses:
  - Lunchbox
  - Ladybug
  - Pufferfish

Install these dependencies and then open the `.gh` file in Rhino3D.
